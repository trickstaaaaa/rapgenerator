I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob a lot
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumille
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
Doomsday
Every since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF the super villain!
Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
"Oh, you're too kind!" "Really? Thanks!"
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine"
He hold his heart when he telling rhyme
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven
He nasty like the old time Old No. 7
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola
Make 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola
I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times
Wreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic
Sleek and lavish people speaking leaking to the maverick
He see as just another felony drug arrest
Any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
Slug through the vest... Shot in the street
For pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat
And when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny
Paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
Now, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?
Set the revolution, let the things bust and thank us
When the smoke clear, you can see the sky again
There will be the chopped off heads of leviathan
My friend, they call 'em strangers
Anybody talk to him end up in some danger
Can't reform 'em
They pray four times a day, they pray five
Who ways is strange when it's time to survive
Some will go of they own free will to die
Others take them with you when they blow sky high
What's the difference? All you get is lost children
While the bosses sit up behind the desks
It cost billions to blast humans in half, into calves and arms
Only one side is allowed to have bombs
It's like making a soldier drop his weapon
Shooting him, and telling him to get to stepping
Obviously, they came to portion up his fortune
Sounds to me like that old robbery/extortion
Mary, you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower, subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, perplexin' like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer load
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit while you would've sold to the highest bidder like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight, lettin' everybody hit it
I like Ally, sometimes she gets bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her to this day, and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably coulda been, if I never meet Eevee
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty, can't find 'em much thinner
If caught I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds
Little young thing, she likes to do the tongue thing
At times, she would play hard to get, grunting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her at Central Park this one time
Had the God mentally sparked, reflectin' sunshine
She said, you need to stop messin' wit that white girl
She fuckin' wit ya head and got ya heart in tight curl
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the Dutch price OT
Plus she from Columbia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish
And Miss Hazy, all the women mature black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' pulled back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is, she make me too lazy
Sugar mommy laced me with the butter Navy Avi
Just her way to makeup for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust
With wild imaginings that you can't discuss
Oh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for peace
It's a daily conflict between man and beast
We strive for God and a better tomorrow
Still suffering from the unforgettable sorrow
Repent from thy sins, son and walk ye straight
Stop talking all that trash boy and talk ye straight
Afflicted by the pressures of life at every vital point
Still, I wouldn't give an oint'
Or flinch an inch or pitch a pinch
Off the pie or every try to try your wench
Confronted by the devil himself and stay strong
You think you can take the King now meet Kong
Strong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting
How many MCs have sprung from our fountain
Fifty thousand year process to make this combination
I'm not giving mine away to Satan
Although I know that he's awaiting
To get a hold of my biochemical equation
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son
Fifty thousand year process, to make this combination
99 elements, biochemical manifestation
I'm not giving mines away to Satan
Although, I know that he's awaiting
I'ma slip him son, I'ma dip him, son
When I catch the drop on him, I'ma clip him, son
Bet ahk, straight to the head with the pet rock
At least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box
Trade a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack
Pay him and it's sewed up like thread and bobbin bonus pack
Invest in the first B-boy kid show
Live off skid row with jive talking negros
He wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly
And kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?
Is he in the backyard or on your front porch
Or standing in the corner of the club with the blunt torched
You're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving
And sold odds and bodkins to old gods and goblins
Golly, I'm just a pest and your worst best friend
Who mend and rip space-time fabric like polyester blend
Not a hobby for no knobby-kneed lesser men
Or sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen
Yo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure
Semi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'
Underneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'
Israeli issued automatic black pistol
The cop with the flashlight chew gum as he whistle
Tapped on the glass, roll it down fast
License, registration addressed to your lab
They made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over
Cuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober
Have you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer
Get out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir
Put one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe
Walk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road
My homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato
Or cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado
They used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em
Then come and puff bowls and make beats inside my basement
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Stress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer
We civilized the uncivilized like we supposed to
Drunk or sober, never lose your composure
Mic in your hand, black man stand as a soldier
Stress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers
If you can't understand, then come closer
One two
It's Masta Ace, Cunninlyguists
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it?
As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast...they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop - Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme (DJ Premier) learned the art of the chop
This is way before SP's...and MPC's
And long before CD's and MP3's
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
Yeah
As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner
"Fuck The Police!!" jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvans
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live.. Florida crews caught heat for rappin
But free speech pollination kept bee's colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggaz that were ready to die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather.. that shit was beautiful
"Seasons Change, mad things rearrange" - Lauryn Hill, "How Many Mics"
"Play me in the winter, play me in the summer, play in the autumn, any order"- Ladybug, "9th Wonder"
"Seasons Change, mad things rearrange" - Lauryn Hill, "How Many Mics"
"Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em
See all them leaves must fall down" - Andre 3000, "13th Floor/Growing Old"
As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two
Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
Assumed that the worst was over
Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October
The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it
Is what they did to people's styles, not what they covered they backs with
Tactics of the skill impaired
No Limit to what they'll do when the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving for who they know, while others get jerked for loot
Cause gettin signed ain't a turkey shoot
No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that
Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap
Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits
Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs
Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn
Before the bottom dropped out in 2K
By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS
Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder
But it's about time for the cycle to start over [echo]
How we gonna start?
"So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin,
a brother got to eat. Why don't you rap for food then."
The music makes me high
even though I stay away from canibus, like Wyclef
(Deacon and Kno, fry sets.)
Similar to Christ,
(we got divine reps so tell me)
If you know your gonna die (why step?)
Show no mercy
(For rules and crews)
You hit with more bricks than new?
(Riddles confusing fools,) like Confucian rules
(Cos most cats are more squared than Rubik's Cubes)
We spit raps that are totally murderous
(The rhymes are like an anaconda serpent clutch)
So check out how these herbs get touched
(Unless your broads giving us brains)
Nigga you ain't servin us
(Deacon and Kno,) cunning lynguists with stunning English
(Our true lies bring more pumps) than Harry Rehnquist
(Every week) with the best speech
Roll with cats who smoke more trees than the flash and burn
techniques
(Sex, beats, between bed sheets)
Red fleets, Pulp Fiction style
(leaving your car with red seats)
We make like fly swatters and smash pests
(Put peeps under more pressure than a Kelly Price bed set)
Keep your bodies looking like samples for the Rorscach Test
(Ink blots,) so fuck around and get your team rocked
(Jugga's in the back with the beam cocked)
Gots to have everything between L.A. and Queens locked
Uh huh, word, uh huh word, yo yo, check it out
Cunninlynguists, know what I'm saying?
You know how we do
I mean, you probably don't know how we do
but you're about to find out.
Like wha, like wha...
Light as a feather
When I'm floatin through
Readin through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
Centimetres of ether I'm heatin the speaker
Motivational teacher with words that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined with discord
It's either genocide, all the planet in uproar
Never good but rules of paradise are never nice
The best laid plan of mice and men are never right
I'm just a vagabond with flowers for algernon
The average joe who knows what the fuck is goin on
It's the hope of my thoughts that i travelled upon
Fly like an arrow of god until I'm gone
So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
Taking chances
Word tap dancing with wolves
In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of arizona
The sun be high, life's ironic
Aint tryin to be talib when I write
Surreal life I paint it vivid habitat crazy insane
Watch the propaganda 6 o'clock news that are saying
Cultures clash for black folk and white trash
They revel in the cyberspace that might crash
Dash to millineum a million miles of runnin
n at the speed of now back don't return gunnin
Rambo style gunho child gunnin
Ammo blao two times loud stunnin
Stunnin when I hit ya lift you off the earth like
Ayo take you right back to birth
And niggaz wonder why they might wonder why
This shit might happen but it does, they go
Driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
So I'm driftin away like a feather in air
Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
Treat you better than me
Because that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength
Where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self
Understanding of the things around me
That becomes the wisdom that I need
Living this life to the best of my ability
Channelling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
Remember me because my clothes remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them pimps in kangols
It never ends I keep it rulin like a cypher
The first caveman bringin fire
Innovating and higher to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this vaccuum-less space
I will survive,
divine the time to cry fuck a hold or hide i'm alive with pride
And I drove the chevy to the levy
But the levy was dry singin "this will be the day that I die"
Crush a coal to a diamond
Eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a niggah to rhyming
Thinking of the better things in life
Thinking of how I could persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating over tropical sands
You my lady, I'm ya man
So let's futher advance to the next scene
Me sleeping next to you resting
You are the personification of all God's blessings
Coming to me in just one physical being
One physical dream that I wanna redeem
You're Voluptuous
Sweet caramel brown honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch, what a niggah do
So sensual
Her smile like a chemical extract of perfection
Rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday on a Thursday
Quiet time love sleep in I wake early
Honey brown wit the long black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare
She's angelic and energetic
Using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing
Her body is just a blessing from God Down to earth
She needs to be in a church to prove that
We didn't spawn from fish but God's work
Hurts to see her clothed cause her body beholds
Secrets untold valued like platinum and gold
For she is the key to open my mind to see
The energy that radiates from the gates of heavenly bliss
I reminisce over touch and kiss
While you fucking a bitch I go make love to my miss
Never scandalous
It unanimous that the how i handled it
Lights off and candle lit rooms and glamorous
Yo I call you love sexual you look edible
Parallel snuggle up close intellectual
In a rendezvous who are you in wrap hairdo
No makeup in jean shorts open toe shoe
I wanna hold you mold ya soul I behold you
Know you better than myself never own you
But keep you never leave you
I beseech you
Gods gift to man is you wearing a see through
Riding Seadoos in Atlantic Ocean
Causing commotion
Lay you down going through the motions
Keep ya skin soft lotions got me coasting
Down pretty round brown thighs the candles low lit
Honey brown wit the long black hair
Teasing me with a kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare
Look at this agreeable
Delightful, delectable
Unforgettable
So sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal To step out of heaven you ready boo
Never hypothetical you factual and magical
Fuck theatrical
Baby girl because you actual
Physically your chemistry is so mathematical
Had to use academics to define your spirit
You lifting my limits
Your name off my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my minds representation
Of a representative
Representing an excellent revelation of time and dedication
Never impatient
She know the deal
Revealed herself to me
So I can see Her heavenly ways
Her heavenly gaze
And plus it don't hurt that she has an ass for days
So as we lay I reminisce on the day that we met
Please god never let me forget
Individual stars float in the ocean of God
Rocking a pinky ring of Saturn while I'm visiting Mars
Egos bigger than Jupiter are breaking the bars
Holding me back down to Earth to physical laws
Touching the moon, grace as I ready resumed
Comets flying through space bringing possible doom
Blocking the sun, bring a holocaust to the world
I'm talking back to Father Time, Mother Earth is my girl
I got the wings of angels walking down the valley of death
Watching my step, 'cause The Devil's never one to respect
Come correct on the studio track, taking it back
To the pen and pad, I blast the original rap
Brother on the B-Boy tip, we Krylon spit
I tag the charts with the graphical hits
So who you fucking with, arm leg led to arm head
Snapping your neck back while you spit out a Pez
I be the original son of a bitch, hurting your wrist
'Cause you spinning my shit so much the needle skipped
Flip to the rhythm and reminisce, remember the days of
'94 (Nine Four) hip-hop was a gift
Words out of her lips came straight from the heart
Never prepackaged or bought, over negative thought
Peddle to consumers, magazines, and rumors
Commercial spots turn real artists to looters
Precise rap, rock and roll, nigga lets do this
I'll float through those break beats with my maneuvers
Yo regardless
While I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations
Speaking to scorpions making my heart turn to porcelain
That used to have a steady beat now its easily broken
My coast and train of thought stopped emotions
Welling at the core of my being causing commotion
Need to release, 'cause the stress tearing me to pieces
My love ceases and my thoughts break into leases
The height of my life, but the strife making me leave this
I can't beat this, going to God to defeat this
Will he help, or do I have to do this myself?
Alone and confused, the blues burden my health
My eyes remain closed 'cause my highs are lows
I'm feeling the blows of rain cause my pain is cold
Now who am I, a man or a pawn in life?
Living day to day, I pray am I wrong or right
Losing my mind so maybe you can help me find
The way to go so I can be leaving this pain behind
Trying to sleep, "Sleep is the cousin of death,"
Said a wise man from Queensbridge, on beats he blessed
Trying to rest, instead I rest my head
On a pillow of hardships, misery is the bed
On my back, I lie, I can see the skies
Through the glass ceiling, the reason tears drowning my eyes
And I can't move, grief won't let me think
My soul is dry; I crawl just to take a drink
I made you blink, think like a visible man
With mechanical hands trying to reach out to my fans
Yo regardless
While I be moving swiftly through darkness
Plotting, charting my path, I'm running, cutting my losses
Stumbling over unknown bumps and complications
And tribulations of my life of revelations
Yo viscosity of the hidden meaning between the words
Thicken the plot, I caught hidden rhythms and
I'm loading the hearse, you biting like a Dracula curse
I'm bringing the worst of hurt like a sermon in church
Pertaining to you, hurts just to listen to truth
So you'd rather listen to lies, so you're living to lose
I'm beginning to win, young man, master descend
Battle within, looking at The Devil and grin
I'm flipping the script, walking on the journey and trip
On the gurney they missed, and the fact that life is a bitch
And I'm hating this shit, losing blood, making me crip
With stakes aside, bet, and I lost the grip
Searching for bliss, with the razor over my wrist
Needing a job but the drug test's checking my piss
I'm looking through a window, seeing the immaculate
conception reborn
Peace in my core with seven swords and knight in a war
Looking to the eyes of the lord, calculating what more
Seeing the signs of heaven nevermore
The last matador riding the pale horse, losing my course
Splitting the hairs, causing divorce
Marriage unborn, I havoc in song, I stumbled upon
Lost jewels of thought, thought to be gone
Lost forever, I sever motherfuckers with letters
Written in script, forward to the rap that I rip
From the top of the lip, make a drink, taking a sip
Then I'm gulping the shit
Falling deeper in the abyss...
Warn the town the beast is loose
Conflicts with night sticks
Illegal sales districts
Hand-picked lunatics, keep poli-TRICK-cians rich
Heretics push narcotics amidst its risks and frisks
Cool cliques throw bricks but seldom hit targets
Private-DIC sell hits, like porno-flicks do chicks
The 666 cut W.I.C. like Newt Gingrich SUCKS DICK
Meanwhile the government brings Star Wars from Glocks to glockers
C.O.P. has an APB out on Chewbacca
Mista Mayor, can I say something in yo honor
Yesterday in Central Park they got the Jogger
Okay, okay
Let's get the confusion straight in ghetto Gotham
The man behind the mask you thought was Batman is Bill Clinton
Who soon retire, the roof is on fire
Connie Chung brung the bomb as it comes from Oklahoma
Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya
On a mountain Satan offered me, Manhattan help me Jah Jah
You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen I bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin
Now you ask me for my license registration
"WHERE THE FUCK" do I work
"WHAT THE FUCK" is my occupation
Well I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney now the cops got Lolly
The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz, or shot up like al Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed
And the fuzz treat bruh's like they manhood never was
And if you too powerful, you get bugged like Peter Tosh and Marley was
And my word does nothing against the feds
So my eyes stay red as I chase crazy bald heads, word up!
Warn the town the beast is loose
The chase is on I feel like the bad guy
Fifth gear 125 like New Jersey drive
Looked in my rear view mirror
Police was getting closer
Heard a roar in the sky
Looked up and saw the Blue Thunder
My inner conscious says throw your handkerchief and surrender
But to who
The star spangled banner ooh
Say can't you see cops more crooked than we
By the dawn's early night robbin' niggas for keys
Easy low key crooked military
Pay taxes out my ass but they still harass me
The streets of corruption got me bustin and cussin' in the Concrete Jungle
Thoughts being dribbled like that tall kid Mutumbo
Handled by Hannibal
Suitable to be a fugitive like Dr. Kimble
(Ay yo should I slow down?)
Nah kid go faster
Just cause they got a badge, they could still be impostors
Probable cause, got flaws like dirty draws
Meet me at the corner store so we can start the street wars
Warn the town the beast is loose
[Raekwon and Method Man:]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though
Wu-Tang five finger shit
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all
Take you on a natural joint
Here we here we go, check this shit, yo
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one
Pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolas at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW! Move from the gate now!
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's been twenty-two long hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through, know what I'm sayin'?
Because you can't just get by no more
Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
One of these days and you wont be long (It wont be long now)
One of these days and you wont be long (You bound to come up)
One of these days and you wont be long (Keep your eyes on us)
One of these days and you wont be long (Yeah, yeah, yeah, Deck)
I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on +The Table+, gots to get locked up
Rebel I's simply slicker, pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on +The Table+, bend off the remy licker
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm Uptown +Saturday Nite+ like Bill Carr's
Got weed in the jars with vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, holdin' the mix
Blast off of my shit, vibratin' the whip	
One of these days and you wont be long (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long (Chef!)
Yo I'm sicker than the V12 [X5]
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off +The Table+
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down
One of these days and you wont be long {Yo} (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long {Yo, yo}
I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This +Verbal Intercourse+, fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the +Triumph+ we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we Too Sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mack 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, +Dat's Gangsta+ shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga
"I got to know"
One of these days and you wont be long (That's what you call it pa)
One of these days and you wont be long
"I got to know"
Woke up this morning, smoked some sticky green to get me started
Choclate thai, all in my eye, I'm never broken-hearted
Bang us in ya cars, bang us in ya Jeep, bang that shit retarded
(Bob Digi) Sun Zeini
(P. Sunn) 12 O'Clock
Two On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)
I love my brother to death
(That old hip-hop, catch this)
(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)
I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex'
Remember 12 O'Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggaz don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggaz carry a cold piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin police
Yo, yo
Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggaz, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggaz hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat
What up kid? Stay livin
Seen you look good, you look live in ya linen
And you survived ninth innin
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggaz that ride that provide to the end of this
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Ain't nothin but the real
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Million dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)
This one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh
We gamble the dice, remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, "Who Dat?"
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that
Two On Da Road, Bobby Digital
He's a gangsta, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Live it up, live it up
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
Bang us in ya Jeeps
Shaolin! Bobby Digital
Uh-huh, Sunn who?
Yeah
Haha! Yeah!
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Get that money y'all
Shout in pain
Uh-huh, yeah
Weed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin
[U-God]
Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit yo
It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
[Raekwon the Chef]
Take it back to the (?), leanin gettin rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggaz, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggaz palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass
Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles
Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"
John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot
New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals
This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see
From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets
"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"
Uh-huh, Mr. Biggs, Track Masters (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know
Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vexed at it, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday
Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggaz in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now
Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
on that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope
We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle
Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
how to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggaz is armed
And when we get there, all my niggaz in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich
Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggaz with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C.
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tears an' shit
"Hip Hop Is Dead"
"Hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead"
"Hip--hip hop" "hip hop" "is dead"
"Hip--hip hop" "hip--hip hop" "is dead"
"Hip--hip hop" "hip hop" "hip hop"
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip inside of my AK
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
Yeah, niggaz smoke, laugh, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Rich ass niggaz is ridin' with three llamas
Revenge in their eyes, Hennesy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya Nas helped grow us up
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million in billin', I helped build 'em up
Gave my nigga my right, I could have gave left
So like my girl Foxy, a nigga went Def
So nigga, who's your top ten?
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?
Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh I they like me--in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly
If hip hop should die we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together
All together now
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead
[crowd chanting "Hip hop!" becomes beat]
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
If it got where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man then a mobster
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to mp3s
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm lookin' over my shoulder
It's about eighty niggaz from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
V. Vaughn—the travelin' Vaudeville Villain
Who don't give a flyin' fuck who ain't not feelin' him
Watch what ya dealin' him: Ace, king, death card
Strong-arm the wrong man, pardon the left, god
Get money and earn it, that everything-you-touch-turn shit
Got much to learn, kid; light it up, burn shit
Light it up like the Dutch when the hash melt
Only time they see him when they meet him with the cash belt
Ay carumba, now that's my number
One dry summer, as far as I remember
Burnt-out, but gainin' every edgy penny
Then he hit him straight to the head like Reggie Denny
Call him back when you need some more yak, Horshack
Doin' 80 down the Van Wyck on horseback
Your man sick, but he wreck tracks, puto
Get back too, bro, exactamundo
Viktor the director flip a script like Rob Reiner
The way a lotta dudes rhyme their name should be "knob shiner"
For a buck, they'd likely dance the Jig or do the Hucklebuck
To Vik it's no big deal, they're just a buncha knuckle-fucks
You wonder how well would they hold up in a holding cell
It sorta had the strange makings of a tale told in hell
Like "Oh well," hold tall riches
If the feds is really after them they just told all the snitches
On borrowed-time rhymes, gassed by the silver screen
They act like their monkey-ass can heal back like Wolverine
Mellow out what y'all bellow out ya yellow mouth
What happened to the kinda spit that used to help a fellow out?
No doubt, leave a rapper in a body cast
And wonder what he was doing while we was in a karate class
Snotty ass, it's really like he was a white-belt
Right before he "night-night" ask him how the light felt
I wouldn't take their tape if they gave it free
Maybe it's me, baby it's V!
Throw down the key, y'all know how shit be
In the naked city, rappers is so giddy
That's no ditty, Vaughn so witty
The way he take no prisoners and show no pity
It's how son became a big man from a black boy
To name names, a really big fan of Dan Aykroyd
He feel they need to give him his own dance
This his only chance to shoot the gift like a lone glance
Or like a beef scene that leave the oo-ey smokin'
Or between Hoktuo Shinken and Nanto Suichō Ken
Great balls of fire
Guess who just crawled out the muck or mire
That could make you trust a motherfuckin' liar
A real shuck n' jiver
Vaughn never been a duck-'n'-diver
He spit on the mic, yuck—saliva
Hold it like a drunk driver hold a CB on a sharp turn
Still clutchin' his chest from the heartburn
What's your handle? I need a Zantac, ock
And thanks before I blank into anyphylactic shock
Rock the disco
Chocolate on a crisco ho
Cock diesel
And still tell a joke like Joe Piscopo
Tell em the basics
Basically, break the Matrix
And just for kicks, make em gel like Asics
That's why they actin standoffish
Eat the beat by hand like canned raw crawfish
Can you please pass the cocktail sauce?
You might as well know, hell is hot as hell boss
Tell my hoss
He said broads call me Vaughny
I make sure I throws em back if they's too scrawny
Or boney, phony MCs use a stand-in
Leave him hangin like if I ain't know where his hands been
Hussy, how bout we bloody up your just for me
Bust a knee
Then go finish study, a plush degree
True victory, a new sick story
I never met a chick that was too thick for me
Holy Moses, my old earth know me closest
On how I played the back and stayed bent like scoliosis
It's no puzzle
You can ask Doc Zizmor
The slow guzzle got your nizzle crooked like Biz's jaw
Drink like a fishy, she wish she was a Pisces
Live since back when 25 cents Icees
Used to turn your tongue the color red
Now they want to fill ya full of lead
What the fuck that young fella said?
What kid?
It's Vaughn the red blooded
Do yourself a favor or come on, get head butted
Yoke him if he run
I'll be there in a jiffy son
With the flame suppressor like off the 151
Quit your bitchin, or get *BLAUW* in your babble-box
Punishment for dry snitchin', so now eat this Travel Fox
You'll be aight once it pass through your yellow belly
Only thing he said was, "Can you please pass the jelly?"
Homo say what? Like a promo play the cut
On the late night, before you touch the mic, get your weight right
A lot of crews like to act like a violent mob
They really need to just shut the fuck up like Silent Bob
Either that or get smoked like hickory
Should squash the beef and go wash their teeth quickly
Know the stee, write a rhyme like a mystery
And sign it on the bottom in calligraphy, "Your nigga, V"
Somewhere out in cop-killin' Queens
Where bo deans stop limousines and niggas flee the scene
Somebody on his back bleeding vest all cracked up
'Freeze clown officer down request for back up'
Listen dude don't get me misconstrued as a sniper
It's V Vaughn not to be confused with V la viper
Or either Peter Parker
Or either Peter Piper
A seed the type to pee the diaper blame it on the wiper
It's really not your concern why I got the knife sir
He suggest remain calm let's not get -- 'No!'
Slash his windpipe he had them type of eyes
He might be still alive
How you get this thing to hyper drive
Oh
Give my props to the shooter
Prices at a all time low in the future
Something like fourteen they must be on horse pills
O T and zero three to re up on force fields
At that cost, deal, he plotted the coordinates
Two thousand three winter time upper west side more or less
This thing be buggin like a celly frontin
Now who the hell is honey wit the slug in her belly stuntin
You ain't have to tell V nothing
Trust him
It really ain't no time for discussion
He'll be back in ninty three press of a button and they busted in
His first impulse was to smack the dirt
All four wore plain clothes and lumberjack shirt
Recognize one face from school six degrees ago
He'd snuff him in his braces just to switch the station to BGO
He kept a punch line every lunch break lunch time
And this is no time to pump fake it's crunch time
The same split second they let off the toast
That's when he hit the speed dial and sped off ghost
I know those cats don't like V
And if they took my head off they'd get off most likely
And probably thought the time gizmo was my wallet
And hit the hills forty more times on some foul shit
Pick a crime he was out in the nick of time
To get paid another day and live to kick a sicker rhyme
For iller, it's like Miller malt liquor time
Up town finery were it's probably not best to flaunt
Everyone's your best friend V steps into the restaurant
My friend, he said, you must be psychic
What's the price of- Fourteen!
It’s good, you like it!
Huh, be back tonight the fourteen G pack was really packed tight
But back at the lab he found that the Sleestak was right
Not only was it three cracks light but too white
The test show lactose, anbesol
Lecithin five types of aspirin and other kinds of medicines
Next time I'll bring my men who speak Mexican
And let the Techs spin
Make 'em contact the next of kin
The whole thing is mostly lactose
Lecithin and some type of aspirin, anbesol medicine
Damn
Let's go get 'em, men!
